# llm-as-classical-rl-implementer
This repository tracks research papers that use large language models (LLMs) to implement classical reinforcement learning (RL) approaches.

The goal is to maintain a structured and regularly updated reading list for researchers, students, and practitioners exploring how LLMs are being used to replicate or enhance classical RL algorithms.
